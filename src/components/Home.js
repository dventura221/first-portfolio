        <p>
          My name is Dan. I made a career pivot from nursing to become a
          software engineer. I am excited and motivated for my next steps. I
          consider myself a dark horse, who is a high performer in the
          background, and speaks up when something needs to be said. I inject
          humor and a silent grace into my environment and work.
